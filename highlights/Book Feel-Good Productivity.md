So my final exercise brings us full circle, and involves learning to think about productivity like a scientist. To experiment with what brings you meaning. And use those experiments to inform the decisions you make every hour. ‘Alignment experiments’ can help you test theories about what might bring you closer to alignment in your day-to-day decision-making. It’s a process with three stages. First, identify an area of your life where your actions feel particularly unfulfilling. The results of your eulogy method, odyssey plan and wheel of life exercises might have helped with this. But even without those exercises, you may feel a sense of misalignment in one or more areas of your life, whether your job, or your relationships, or your hobbies. Think about it – is there anywhere you feel things aren’t going well? Think of a lawyer who has spent years climbing the corporate ladder, but who has come to realise that the long hours and high-stress environment are taking a toll on her personal life. For her, an alignment experiment might involve exploring alternative work arrangements that align better with her values. Or imagine a college student who chose a degree based on external expectations, like pressure from family, rather than his own genuine interests. He might find himself struggling to feel engaged in classes and worrying that he’s not on the right path for his future career. In this case, an alignment experiment might involve examining alternative educational pathways. Second, come up with your hypothesis. We’re thinking like scientists here, and that means adopting an experimental mindset. All"
	- "adopting an experimental mindset. All scientific experiments have an ‘independent variable’, the one thing you change to see what effect it could have.
