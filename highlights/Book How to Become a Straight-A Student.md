	- Writing an Academic Paper
		- "Step # 1. Target a Titillating Topic
			- Start looking for an interesting topic early."
		- Step # 2. Conduct a Thesis-Hunting Expedition
			- Start with general sources and then follow references to find the more targeted sources where good thesis ideas often hide.
		- Step # 3. Seek a Second Opinion
			- A thesis is not a thesis until a professor has approved it.
		- Step # 4. Research like a Machine
			- Find sources.
			- Make personal copies of all sources.
			- Annotate the material.
			- Decide if you’re done. (If the answer is “no,” loop back to # 1.)
		- Step # 5. Craft a Powerful Story
			- There is no shortcut to developing a well-balanced and easy-to-follow argument.
			- Dedicate a good deal of thought over time to getting it right.
			- Describe your argument in a topic-level outline.
			- Type supporting quotes from sources directly into your outline.
		- Step # 6. Consult Your Expert Panel
			- Before starting to write, get some opinions on the organization of your argument and your support from classmates and friends who are familiar with the general area of study.
			- The more important the paper, the more people who should review it.
		- Step # 7. Write Without the Agony
			- Follow your outline and articulate your points clearly.
			- Write no more than three to five pages per weekday and five to eight pages per weekend day.
		- Step # 8. Fix, Don’t Fixate
			- Solid editing requires only three careful passes:
				- The Argument Adjustment Pass: Read the paper carefully on your computer to make sure your argument is clear, fix obvious errors, and rewrite where the flow needs improvement.
				- The Out Loud Pass: Carefully read out loud a printed copy of your paper, marking any awkward passages or unclear explanations.
				- The Sanity Pass: A final pass over a printed version of the paper to check the overall flow and to root out any remaining errors."
